# 🖐️ Air Cursor

**Control your computer using your hands — no touch, just motion.**

Air Cursor is an experimental computer vision project that lets you move and control your mouse pointer using **hand gestures** via your webcam. Built with **MediaPipe** and **OpenCV**, it tracks your hand in real-time to control cursor movement, clicks, and even click-and-drag — all through natural hand motions.
